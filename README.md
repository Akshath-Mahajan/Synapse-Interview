# Cosine Text Similarity

We have implemented the cosine text similarity task in three different methods:

1. Using count vector method
2. Using sklearn's TfidfVectorizer
3. Using word2vec model from genism

All the details of these methods are documented in the notebook's markdown cells.

This project is situated in ./Task_One/TextSimilarity/TextSimilarityCosine.ipynb

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

We have implemented the sentiment analysis task in two different methods:

1. Using Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
2. Using textblob library

All the details of these methods are documented in the notebook's markdown cells.

# Data Cleaning and Visualization

We have split task two into two parts:

1. Data Cleaning /Non Visual Analytics
2. Data Visualization / Visual Analytics.

All the details and logic for this are documented in the notebook's markdown cells.

This project is situated in ./Task_Two/DataVisualization.ipynb
